@julesinmed,"Personally, I think hard work should lead to smart work. We tend to associate the term hard work with concepts like long hours, lack of sleep and exhaustion, while it would be more useful if these circumstances were seen as a ''prompt'' to find a way to work smarter (simply to avoid being crushed by them, following natural evolution and self-preservation).

@zirak21mistry,"""You can work hard and still do poorly"". Can't agree more. All my engineering years, I worked fairly hard, put in multiple extra hours, and attended extra classes. Even after all this extra effort, I managed to get slightly about average grades whereas my few talented peers worked half as hard but produced double the results with exceptional grades. That was the moment when I realised that it is more to it than just hard work.

Everyone always says to work harder and harder. They say that you have not yet achieved success because you have not worked hard enough. 

I feel it is only so much hard work you can do because you have limited time and energy and it is only a matter of time before your genetics give up and you get burnt out (probably multiple times) and give up eventually.

Finally someone can understand my point of view. Glad I found you and your channel.",1 year ago,622,False,Contra

@IamKudos,"Really love this video. I think the reason people love to say ""Hard work beats talent"" is because they see talent as this mysterious gift that people have been privileged with by genetics or something. People don't want to flip a stone to check and see what really is talent. It's just better cognitive recognition and higher-order learning that people do accidentally for one thing. And because they didn't realize that they were doing that, they cant seem to apply that for others. Hence that becomes their ""talent"". And people like things explained in simplified terms. So they don't even want to wrap their head around what talent really is, or if they can DEVELOP or LEARN to be smart, to be talented. Deploying your brain is seeming to be harder to people than just passively putting in a grind of 10 hours of hard work. When you're active and aware of the processes you're using to improve yourself, you will achieve something even better than talent.",1 year ago,213,False,Pro
@deletedaxiom6057,"The sharpening the axe section reminded me of an instance where I was tutoring a student. He was in cal 2 and he was having trouble with some problem and was an engineering major.

I told him, ""hey this problem would be way easier right here, if you used log rules so just go back and review them it'll take you like 15 mins."" 
He decided that he would rather just memorize and keep doing the same problem again and again rather than going back to basics for a refresher. It was frustrating watching someone just ""work"" hard for little results.
The best thing about tutoring mathematics was constantly going over the basics as you see new things and connections. So going back to the basics is often very very useful, occasionally.

@dhaufjebzjchseis3828,"when I was in elementary school I was in special ed. Teachers considered holding me back a year. I grew up believing I was stupid and was told so by many around me. I graduated high school with a 95% average with nearly 100% in physics and over 95% in math and chemistry. I'll now be graduating from UCLA with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. My point is a lot of the time when you consider yourself untalented in something it's because you haven't put the work in to discover your talent. If I had listened to everyone around me claiming that I would never be good at math and science because I simply lacked the talent I would have given up. Instead, I worked hard and realized I was never dumb but that instead I just needed to try different learning methods and discovered I actually had an aptitude for these subjects. People underestimate how much work It takes to be good at something and how much work so-called ""talented"" people have put in.

Hardwork beats talent when talent doesnt work hard. Wherever a person is on the bell curve for that sport, job or education occupation, the hardwork will boost them to give them their best performance possible.

So my disagreement is that its not just simply working smarter or harder, its finding your genetic strengths educational field, sport, job anything something that u love doing as well and then putting in the hardwork.

@petertodorov5592,"this exact scenario ive been on both sides of. The reason people put less effort and succeed in studying is because they understand the essence of the material - which only happens if you grasp the fundamentals from lesson 1 and never break this ""chain"" (as my teachers call it). From then on you just need to listen in every class about only half the time ( because a big part of it is fluff to make understanding it easier ) and its smooth sailing. 

Another way is if they are interested in the subject and have already done personal projects that are more advanced than school material.

If you fall behind from the start the only real way ive found of catching up is by just asking. Ask someone who understands the material to explain it to you and you cheat the system by learning x10 faster. Usually the other person wont bother you and himself with details and will only explain the essence of the subject really well which is enough for you to be able to study the details on your own, or you just ask about the details aswell.

Therefore using the excuse that people are gifted as an excuse to not improve is unacceptable. Unless you have truly made an attempt to surpass someone using smart strategies.

The perception was that I didn't care enough to attend those camps and that I would just show up with the skill level I had, but what no one knew was that while they spent thousands of dollars attending camps and not progressing, I was in my backyard running sprints, going to the gym to get stronger, teaching myself new tricks to use and envisioning myself using my skills on the field.

That is analagous to studying your ass off by copying your notes over and over and going to the exam.

The rts analogy is as such

 There is a saying in card games/ rts games , and that is 

To win, you must either
A) play much faster than your opponnent 
B) play slightly slower than your opponent.

Fast(means rush out tier 1s and go) slow( means eco up then steamroll)

A) If your exam is in 2 weeks, there is no time to sharpen your axe or eco up. Just do the most high yield stuff, which is almost always to get your hands on past year questions and do them over and over.

B) if your exam is in 6 months time, then spend time to learn how to learn.

Try to develop an interest in whatever you are studying. If you have to study something really boring that you really dislike, then try to read up on interesting things about that topic.

Theres a particular model in psychology that discusses this phenomenon.

3) the further you progress in your field of expertise, the more factors like e.g motivation, volition etc gain importance.

Overall, theres certain fields of expertise that require a certain amount of talent (e.g logical thinking, motor skills etc). In fields that require at least a minimum of talent in tthose areas, its probable that you wont achieve the same success or expertise as someone with those talents.

@darkforcekiller,"The problem lies within the word ""work"" itself.
We usually refer to work as something we dont really want to do but have to ""endure"" in order to gain something (money, status). But people who show natural passion towards a subject/hobby do not see work (or better: effort) as something they have to ""endure"". They are emotionally connected to the subject and are thus passionate by default.

Also, i think its naive to treat practise/studying as something purely quantitative. The quality and what youre actually doing while studying/practising matters a lot. If you play an instrument, it might be more wise to spend 1 hour focused on a narrow problem rather than 3 hours of just fooling around. Thats why everyone has that one friend who plays the guitar for 10 years but who still sounds kind of amateurish. 

However, i definitely think everyone of us has some natural inclinations (wherever theyre from, internal/external) towards certain subjects. Though the sad thing is that capitalism doesnt really give a crap about peoples personal passions. Capitalism wants as many qualified people as possible in the most profitable and promising areas (engineering, computer science, accounting). Thus, i think a lot of modern students are actually being kind of ""manipulated"" and forced into those subjects while still being too young to actually assess their personal gifts. (They might have the intellectual capabilities to be engineers/software developers/accountants, but the question is do they really enjoy being that or are they just mostly doing it for the monetary gain?)

@jasonm7684,"This is because we live in a meritocracy, where we feel justified worshiping people who 'work hard' and therefore merit praise and attention. The meritocracy stems fundamentally from the idea that the brain is like a blank slate that you can, through hard work and practice, imbue/instill/fill with talent and skill. The reality is that the brain is not totally a blank slate and not totally a genetic treasure trove of talent and skill. The reality is that we are genetically gifted with certain mental abilities and it makes certain tasks that society values easier to achieve than others. The problem is that society tends to value certain traits that certain races seem to have more of than others. For example, our school system merits you grades based on your ability to generally memorize facts and keep attention on things that are generally boring and pointless(think things like history class). To those of us who have these two key mental abilities more so than others, we succeed heavily. In black peoples case, it may be that you all lack that ability and thus are not able to compete on the level that the meritocracy requires. Societies response to this is to tell you to 'work harder' but the reality is you could work just as hard as your peers or twice as hard and still only achieve a percentage of what they do. Another point to make is; does 'working hard' have a genetic competent to it? This is important because if the ability to work hard is even partially innate, telling people to work hard is the equivilant of telling a 5'7 guy to dunk on this 6'5 power forward.

Here, at such a high level (that can be a masters degree, like his example) I think there are two reasons why some people seem much more talented than others: 1 they know all the interconnected knowledge bases comprehended on the new presented subject 2 they are used to concatenate (not necessarily them, but different knowledge bases), so it's not an overwhelming task to his/her brain.",1 year ago,0,False,Pro

@makotheshark3365,"People are mistaken about talent :) Everyone is talented for everything, you just have to feel it ( to be in tune to what you do). It's about perspective switch :D

When drawing, the spirits of Michelangelo, Leonardo and all great artists are within us. The hands are completely relaxed, gentle yet firm and drawing confident lines. Behind each stroke there's a love :D
 When playing music we embody the spirits of Mozart, Bethoven and all great musicians :) We feel the songs with our ears, but also feel the whispers of our heart, the emotions, energy put into it and feel the music we play.

What people talented  is their heart, their passion.. the excitement, yearning, curiosity and inspiration which makes them so drawn into it to be able to do it whole day with joy and try new things, improving, learning every day. It's approach, a mindset what someone would say but also a spirit, will.

It's about being completely relaxed and always immersed in flow state. When you put your heart, soul, mind and body into it.. fully focused that no matter what tries to distract you you're unwavered and do it with love, smile, excitement you can feel it.

You can master everything, you already are :) just have to believe and stay in your vibration. There's a flow in everything, when you're relaxed, gentle (""slow"" yet fast) and conscious about your moves you are able to notice those subtle things that talented people do.

@CraftingHock,"I agree with (almost) everything. I 100% believe in sharpening the axe and have been spreading the mantra for the past 2 years. One thing I would alter from your video is that flashcards can be a useful, highly-efficient tool. I use Anki which is a spaced repetition app. What I love about the tool is that I can keep studying material from years ago and the process not be burdensome because my cards become so spread out with time. Because of my system, instead of having to re-learn any calc1 or calc2 to take multivariable (for example), I already have all the material locked away in my memory. I save myself so much time by not needing to re-learn old material: especially as material very frequently reappears in later courses in my STEM degree. This Fall for example I am taking probability which my professor just emailed us we need to make sure we have Series from calc2 nailed down: something I do not need to worry about restudying as I already have the material in my head.

I like to keep an open mind though and would love to hear your opinions on maybe how my system could be more efficient. I have watched some of your other videos and like everything, but feel some of the claims about flashcards do not hold water: at least not how I use them.

@SayedMohammadMinhajUdDin,"All in all it can be said that it should be a combination of both which can pronounced as right work. However, it is subjective and differ from individual to individual as rightly argued by justin. By the way this whole debate depends upon the final outcome and since there is no one way to achieve it one can tailormade the process as per there need. I think one of the best way to do is to simplify the things that you are in as much as possible. Because this hardwork and smartwork debates in terms of outcome are relative measures  which depends on competitors and many times it is almost impossible to know to whom you are competing (means how talented they are or how much effort they are making). In such situations simplification of your work with best doable effort (ofcourse inferred from some proven process) from your side would be the most appropriate approach.

Take the example of one if the India's toughest exam IIT JEE. Lakhs of aspirants are writing this exams.  There are hundreds of coaching classes each differ in terms of faculty and the stragey that they provide. In such situation how an individual aspirant would know what would be the best strategy. There this strategy of simplification of work would probably the most suitable one.

In the question of which is better, talent or hard work, my understanding is that this is a contest between innate ability to do something, and working to give yourself the ability to do something. So it's a direct comparison between what you're given when you're born and what you create on your own, with your own hands, that has not been given to you. Therefore the hard-work side of things, in this ""contest"", is not actually defined so precisely as to distinguish hard from smart work. Both 'hard' and 'smart' work will fall under the term 'hard work' here, because ultimately its just a contest between what you gain vs what you were given, not how you gain it.

3) 'Success' in addition to the above three things require a market fit; you want to be in a field where there are many winners; if there are too few winners then you can never beat talent. For example, professional sports leagues have too few winners; unless you have a lot of natural talent, you have absolutely no chance, whereas software engineering has many winners; many people are able to make a lot of money doing this.
4) Ideally, you also want to be in a field where your work is judged as objectively as possible, otherwise there is another criteria for success: ""connections"", and if you don't have those, then it'll be challenging achieving success in more subjective professions (artists, actors etc..).

There are people who have very well suited brains for their chosen path so they will perform kinda well or even great without putting in alot of work.

However from my point of view, the existence of hardwork itself is due to the existence of talented people, for instance in the past Newton had invented calculus and people that now we know have understood its concept, however that's for certain case where hard-work is unable to beat talent, I do know for sure that Newton had been working hard to achieve his formula, however that's due to the brain of his connecting the threads together that constructed the formula, he would never be capable of getting theories without using his talent.

A hard-working person would be able to replicate perfectly someone's achievement, however the gap still remains, did you come up with it yourself? Maybe, maybe not.
For instance, there's a book with bigger size and tougher paper, the other is a small book with fragile paper-texture, how can they match? It depends on the uses, whereas the small have different uses than the big one, this puts talent and hard-work into the same category, they both serve the same purpose differently, while the talented ( In this case a bigger book ) and the hard-work ( Small book ) can never replicate it entirely, it can however contain the same information that talented people have.

@inrisalvatore9520,"I don't believe in multiple inteligences, therefore I have a different understanding about what would be talent. In this regard, inteligence is just a capacity to learn things and use the knowledge that you have, as you can see, this definition  of inteligence is very general and can be applied to a whole raft of activities. On the other hand, I believe in natural interests. Some people are more interested in a given activity and, therefore, they are going to expend more time on it. For instance: let's assume that two people have the same level of inteligence. But the first person is more interested in math, whilist the second person is more interested in  music. 

They are going to dedicate their natural power (inteligence) in their respective interests and It will leads them to become good in different activities, even though  they have the same capacity to learn. To sum up, talent is inteligence + personal interest + the amount of time dedicated. Therefore, if you have a low IQ, but you are deeply interested in history, you may perform better than other people in this area, even if they were smarter than you. But if someone who is smarter than you decide to invest their time studing history, this person can absolutely beats you. 

Even because, just like you said in the video, there is some sort of roof when it comes to the use of time, in a way that after that point your results will no longer compensate your efforts. Any way, if the difference in intelligence between two people is too big, then there is no amount of effort that the less inteligent person can put in order to compete with the smarter one.",1 year ago,0,False,Pro

@szebike,"¬†@jasonm7684¬†  I do not agree with your sentiment, first in in any professional sports its about your biological body and how much doping you can endure without getting sick or detected nothing to do with talent its a different matter. In anything else talent means you don't suffer from practicing and you do it because you love what you do (similar to your ""Ikigai""). If you suffer on the way to to achieve your ""goal"" and force yourself to become like a doctor etc. you don't wan't to do it you just do it to please others or artificial motivation which is usally very brittle and you usally fail. A ""talented"" doctor however is curious and insanely fascinated about even the idea of being a doctor and never gets tired of his goal even in hardship. Yes it is rare and needs a lot of self discipline and a strong interest in a certain field. So it depends on your motive to do a thing if your motive is becoming best or making money maybe its hard to become ""talented"" if your motive is just doing the thing you love and you have the right apporach to practicing becoming better then yes everyone can achieve everything (except sports like mentioned).",1 year ago,0,True,Pro
@jasonm7684,"¬†@szebike¬† Wrong again; the problem is that in society the process of getting to become something, take for example a doctor, is usually filled with difficult obstacles that do not have much direct bearing on the doctor you want to be. These obstacles are there to weed out the talented people vs the ones that simply want to be a doctor for money or are simply passionate about it. Ask yourself this, if you were taking a flight somewhere on a plane and you were given three options for pilot; one is a gifted and talented pilot, two is a pilot who does it for the money and three is a pilot who is passionate about being a pilot, who would you choose? If you are logical, you will choose the talented pilot because talented pilots are recognized as being the most competent. So in summary, your wrong because passion is not enough to overcome obstacles set out by many professions.Another good example is law. Lawyers have to pass difficult exams to be able to practice law. You could be the most passionate law person in the world, but if you do not have talent required to test good, you will not become a lawyer. The reality is these tests aren't really required for you to be a good lawyer because you dont use a lot of your memory to be a good lawyer, you use good communication skills and strategization to do so. However, in our society if you dont have talent for testing, it is unlikely you will be a lawyer. My cousin tried to do law and I told her its unlikely because she wont pass the tests, unfortunately i was right, she doesn't have these skills and failed three times. In summary, passion is not enough because to become something in society usually requires you to go outside of that passion and o unrelated tasks such a testing to become them and you need skills to overcome those obstacles ie. talent.",1 year ago,0,True,Contra

@shinejnn2,"Tbh, first of all, I respect your helpfulness to these study guidances, but unfortunately I'd basically useless to know about them .


Your saying is still complicated and not getting to the point.

To those who wanna learn how to study efficiently, you just need to know what's the purpose of studying, then you basically unlock all the knowle5gou want to know.

And if You Don't know how or why. Then time to get research  into it instead of keeping studying stuff you doesn't even understand now. Stop it, get it out and find reasons behind study.",1 year ago,0,False,Neutral
@martinmartinmartin2996,"Why a group of  Hard Work people can beat a single Talented people.  This article forgets about   M O T I V A T I O N.
My country   Z_ _ _  has some hard workers and few dedicated Talented people that produce more powerful weaponry 
than the enemy , P _ _ _ _ _ ,  which has ten times the number of workers and  Talented people !

@flamethekid,"everyone has a talent, its just that most of them are useless as fuck to the point that alot of them can't even be turned into a hobby.

hard work will only ever pass a talent that doesn't work hard or a talent that is unlucky.

aside from hardwork and talent, luck is the bigger part of this.
luck is what puts people where they are more than hardwork or talent.

there are hard working talented geniuses that could potentially be the next Einstein or Marie Curie, but they are stuck tending a ricefield in north korea or hunting for bushmeat in the congo and they will most likely live and die there without outside intervention at the right time and place",1 year ago,0,False,Contra
